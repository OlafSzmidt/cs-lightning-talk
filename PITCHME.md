### A little bit about myself

My name is **Olaf Szmidt**

I'm a **3rd** year CS UOM student

I enjoy programming =)

Note:

- **placement** at Ocado Technology as a full stack

### What's my project?

- **Attendance Taking System for Lectures and Laboratories**
- A replacement for the current method with a newly designed improved one.

Note:

- No or little effort from staff
- Something relatively cheap, limited budgets
- Easy to maintain, easy to use by all parties
- Low effort required from student (bottle neck UX research)
- **END: 30-40secs**
---

### Importance of attendance management

- Able to give support to individuals before it's too late.
- It can show correlation with students' <span class="gold"> educational success </span>

Note:

- **END: 1min**

### Current system - and what's wrong with it?

Note:

- Here are the... **Questions to ask myself**

+++

### Current system - and what's wrong with it?

- It requires a lot of <span class="gold"> manual labour</span>.

Note:

- Lecturer walking around with tablet, looking for student id etc
- People walking out to the toilet?

+++

### Current system - and what's wrong with it?

- It requires a lot of <span class="gold"> manual labour</span>.
- Laboratory system differs from lectures greatly.

Note:

- Do we want this decoupling of two separate systems?
---

### Definition of attendance

Lecture attendance might be <span class="gold">different</span> than laboratory attendance.

Note:

- What does it actually mean to be **present**?
- **END: 1:35min**
---

### What's on my mind...

Handheld devices being passed around the lecture hall or laboratory, where
each student scans it with their student card.

Note:

- Sends requests to a central, secure server
- The server will hold timetables of each student
- Marks automatically based on time to decide which lecture

- **END: 2:20min**
