### What's my project?

- **Attendance Taking System for Lectures and Laboratories**
- A replacement for the current method with a newly designed improved one.

---

### Importance of attendance management

- Able to give support to individuals before it's too late.
- It can show correlation with students' <span class="gold"> educational success </span>

---

### Current system - and what's wrong with it?

- It requires a lot of <span class="gold"> manual labour</span>.
- Laboratory system differs from lectures greatly.

---

### Definition of attendance

Lecture attendance might be <span class="gold">different</span> than laboratory attendance.

---

### What's on my mind...

Handheld devices being passed around the lecture hall or laboratory, where
each student scans it with their student card.

---

### What hardware do I need?

- Low <span class="gold"> energy </span> consuption.
- Easy to develop on.
- <span class="gold"> Portable. </span>
- Cheap.
- <span class="gold">NFC and Wifi</span> enabled, or compatible with external NFC and WiFI addons.
